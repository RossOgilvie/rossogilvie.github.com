<p>Master of None is a ten episode comedy series starring Aziz Ansari. The show was entertaining, though not laugh-out-loud funny to me. There are two sorts of episode, either there is a standard sitcom type premise, or otherwise a strong theme or issue. The themed episodes were generally brilliant, and the sitcom ones forgettable.</p>
<p>The first themed episode is “Parents”. This is an attempt by the characters to get to know their parents stories; the sacrifices they made as immigrants to come to American and work hard to build a good life for their children. There are flashbacks, and its quite touching. In particular, the way the Asian father opens up about butchering his pet chicken for food, and the resulting admiration and respect that allows the children to understand and appreciate their parents.</p>
<p>This idea is revisited in a latter episode with grandparents “Old People”, though not as well.</p>
<p>The episodes “Indians on TV” and “Ladies and Gentlemen” deal respectively with racism in the entertainment industry and feminism. The former is a alright episode. It presents the argument that “the audience isn’t ready for two Indians to have a show”, which is an argument I have some sympathy for. It’s a two edged sword, which the show walks itself; to be a show with broad appeal, one has to deal with ‘normal’ issues and can’t ride on the novelty factor of having a bunch of minorities. But on the other hand, the minority issues are something that minority people face, and so it would be equally disingenuous to ignore them completely. Hence a TV show with an Indian lead having an episode about discrimination against casting Indian leads. Side discussions about presentation of stereotypes, yes the cab driver is likely to be Indian with a strong accent but does it need to be that way all the time?, also raise interesting questions of balance.</p>
<p>The feminism episode somehow comes at the same general target, but from a different angle. Namely that issues can be dismissed as imagined. It starts out with a big set-piece of walking home from a bar, the two guys having a good old time and the lone woman looking over her shoulder, being stalked and having to call the police. From this blatant problem, it moves on to ever more nuanced ones, such as a producer only shaking hands/introducing himself to the males at the table. Similar to the Indian cab driver: any particular incident is excusable, but the overall pattern builds to significant problem. This is coupled with a key line about how the problem is dismissed on each example, if you don’t have to suffer from the totality of it.</p>
<p>Finally, there is an arc of ‘love’ episodes. The crazy date to Nashville was alright, but so far fetched. The timelapse episode “Mornings” was the best, showing the relationship unfold over the course of a year via little vignettes of their morning routine. Them learning to live together. The little fights. The change in the tempo of their sex lives. Transitioning from passionate infatuation into a steady love. Her interviewing for a job in a different city, but deciding not to take it. Which leads to the final episode, a wedding kicks of thoughts about settling down, and how to know if a person is suitable to be with ‘forever’. The conclusion the show gives, and perhaps its one of those things where it is written so everyone sees what they want to see, is that one can’t worry too much about it. If its good enough, then its good and its enough, and you just have to commit and hope for he best. It ends with them broken up and moving countries, Italy and Japan respectively, and a cliff hanger as to the future.</p>
