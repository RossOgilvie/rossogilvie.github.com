<p>Welcome again to Triple J Hottest 100 Facts! <a href="http://rossogilvie.id.au/posts/triplej/">Last year</a> I looked at what factors contribute to a song’s popularity. This year I want to turn the focus on you, the voting public. Following the methodology of <a href="https://100-warm-tunas.nickwhyte.com/2017/">Warm Tunas</a>, I pulled people’s votes from Instagram to amass a data set of 2,584 ballots totalling 24,695 votes. Last year there were 2.25 million votes cast, so this represents a sample of about 1%.</p>
<p>To be eligible for entry into the Hottest 100 this year, a song must ‘premiere’ between December 2016 and November 2017. Triple J lists 1887 songs for you to choose from on their website, but this did not stop some impassioned aficionados from writing in their own choices. Specifically 2.5% of people voted for a song that was eligible last year. One in six people of those people voted for more than one. I even found one special person who wrote in five songs from last year. So without further ado, I present the hottest songs of 2016, as voted for in January 2018.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Middle Kids - Edge of Town (This was covered by Paul Dempsey for Like a Version in 2017, which may explain the popularity)</li>
<li>Smith Street Band, The - Death to the Lads (#21)</li>
<li>Teskey Brothers, The - Pain and Misery</li>
<li>Dean Lewis - Waves</li>
<li>Thundamentals - Never Say Never (#168)</li>
<li>Skeggs - Spring has Sprung (#170)</li>
<li>Pnau - Chameleon (#11)</li>
<li>Dune Rates - Bullshit (#33)</li>
<li>Big Sean - Bounce Back</li>
<li>Alex the Astronaut - Already Home</li>
</ol>
<p>These people seem to have all made an honest mistake, but there are some people who don’t even care. I leave you with this gem</p>
