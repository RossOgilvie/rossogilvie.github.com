<p>I finished reading The Player of Games by Iain Banks a few days ago. It is a Culture novel, where the protagonist (Gurgeh) travels to a distant, less advanced empire to compete in a complicated board game (Azad), which they use to determine social rank and job qualifications. The main character wins, or rather is about to when the Emperor goes mad from his impending loss and everyone is killed. The implication is the regime will now topple and Culture will transition the society to a ‘better’ one.</p>
<p>I didn’t see the mad emperor twist coming, and actually thought the final game could have gone either way. He had put an assassination attempt in the chapter before, so I thought he had got the action sequence out of the way. Banks used the game styles of the players as a metaphor for their respective societies (this is explicitly spelt out). In hindsight, Iain ‘the Culture is perfect’ Banks could never stand to have the Culture lose, so the outcome was inevitable. But there were some interesting explanations of how non-egalitarian power structures result in dominance and abuses intrinsically.</p>
<p>I enjoyed two things about the book. Firstly, in the first part before Gurgeh goes to the Empire, he is bored in his life. The author captures well the feeling of purposelessness. It is a combination of frustration and ineffectivity that one can act freely but does not know how to achieve the desired life meaning. Of going through the motions, and though they are pleasant, perfect even, it is not enough. His way out of it is obsession, not exactly uplifting. And the book finishes with a happily-ever-after, so it is unclear whether this apathy could return (or if he is just so gosh darn relieved to be home after his crazy adventure).</p>
<p>The other thing was the descriptions of barbarity and depravity in the Empire. when the main character walks the streets and sees senseless violence (a gang betting a old man, people watching in indifferent entertainment), of systemic injustice, and hypocritical sexual violence on the tv channels accessible on to the ruling class. That transgressions become fetishised. The reverse prescription is a society wide version of an attitude to child-rearing that forbides nothing but teaches moderation.</p>
<p>On this latter point, it is unclear to me how the Culture avoids this trap. To continue the analogy, one doesn’t ban a thing from a child, but instead makes them not want it by social and class pressure that forms into a character trait. But applied on a large scale, isn’t that pressure functionally equivalent to a law? Why won’t it create a taboo that could be subverted in the same way? Perhaps an important feature is how widely the thing is desired; that is the level of hypocrisy in the norm. Compared murder and homosexuality for instance. Or maybe it is a power thing; one group enjoys something precisely because they know <em>they</em> can get away with it.</p>
